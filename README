ResourceProxy
=============
[a Rails plugin]

ResourceProxy introduces a level of indirection when accessing a model in 
a controller.


Example
=======

In controller:
@car = Car.find_proxy(params, [:session, :ar], {:store => session})

will try to find first via SessionProxy, then via ActiveRecordProxy
passing :store option for former and no options for latter.

Returned proxy should act somewhat like the model it proxies.
