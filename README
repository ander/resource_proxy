ResourceProxy
=============
[a Rails plugin]

ResourceProxy introduces a level of indirection when accessing a model in 
a controller.


Example
=======

In controller:
@car = Car.find_proxy(params, [:session, :ar], {:store => session})

will try to find first via SessionProxy, then via ActiveRecordProxy
passing :store option for former and no options for latter.

Returned proxy should act somewhat like the model it proxies.


Subresources can be defined this way:
@tire = Tire.new_proxy(params, [:session, :ar], {:store => session, 
                                                :belongs_to => :car})

new_proxy is the same as find_proxy but may feel more natural
where you would normally use Model.new
